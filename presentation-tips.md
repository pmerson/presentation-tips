You are going to give a technical presentation to colleagues at work? You submitted a proposal to talk at a conference and
it got accepted? The presentation is online? In person? In any case, if you like me were **not** born a great speaker, 
don't worry. There are a few key tips that we can learn, practice, and apply to help us create and deliver a great technical presentation.

## *Preparation*

### 1. Provide value
Prepare a presentation that will allow attendees to successfully apply your ideas and experiences in their organizations.

### 2. Avoid bloated slides
Audiences like illustrated slides better than text-heavy slides. Bulleted points should be no longer than two lines. 
Break long sentences into two bullets. If a slide has more than 5 or 6 bullets, consider splitting it into two slides.
If the presentation will be recorded, there's less need for textual information in the slides. If only the slides will
be shared for future reference, the content should make sense without the oral explanation. 

### 3. Enhance your presentation
Sensibly use pictures, graphs, tables, videos, callouts, animations, diagrams, and quotes to make your presentation 
more interesting. Imagery will improve attendees' retention and enjoyment.  üòä

### 4. Create readable content
The tip states the obvious, but a common complaint is that the text is not readable, especially text in diagrams. 
If you use PowerPoint or a similar tool, here's a simple way to check readability: print your presentation in 
2 slides-per-page format; if you can easily read the printouts, the slides should be readable on screen.  ü§ì

### 5. Manage time
Another common complaint is that the presenter didn't cover all the slides or rushed through the final slides. 
If your session allows interaction throughout, be careful to cut short lengthy discussions. And above all, follow the next tip.

### 6. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
The secret to a great presentation is to practice, practice, practice. Rehearse your presentation at least two times to 
train yourself on the flow of ideas. Don‚Äôt forget to time it when rehearsing, and fine-tune the amount of material 
you can cover. If you practice in front of the mirror or camera, you can evaluate your body language and posture. 
If it's an important presentation, you can also present to colleagues and try to improve based on their feedback before D-day.

Here the tips may vary if the presentation is in person or online. The differences are indicated. 

### 7. Be natural
Your audience will be made up of your peers, and they want you to and will help you do a great job.
Relax and be yourself, as in a conversation by the water cooler. Do not switch to "pres-en-ta-tion
mode" and speak in a monotonic way like the Terminator (it's ok to dress up and look cool like
him, though). üòé

### 8. Be engaging
It's your job to keep everyone awake and engaged, and that's not easy, especially
after lunch. Be dynamic and energetic. ‚ö° Show that you‚Äôre passionate about the topic.  üòç  To establish
a rapport with the audience, tell a relevant story or simply... smile. üôÇ Avoid reading notes or your
slides. 
In some situations (keynotes, some webinars) questions are left to the end. Otherwise, you should stimulate participation
with questions and comments at any time. Look for places in your presentation where you can ask something to 
participants, maybe their experience with what you just talked about. Periodically ask if there are any questions. 
- **IN PERSON**:
    - Make eye contact to random people in the room.
    - At the very beginning or right after a break, if you're waiting for a few people, tell an interesting or funny story to kill time. 
- **ONLINE**:
    - Speak to the camera, which should be on all the time for the presenter.
    - When someone says something in the chat window or out loud in the mic, say the person's name when you give your reply.
    - It's quite common to miss a question or comment in the chat window. If there isn't anyone to help you monitor messages
  in the chat, invite everyone to use the mic to ask questions or to let you know of a message you missed in the chat.  üòâ
    
### 9. In 1 minute, give attendees a reason to stay for the next 30 minutes
Especially at conferences, people step in or join virtual rooms for a short while to decide whether they want to stay for
the whole presentation. The first minutes of your talk will help them decide, and
you don‚Äôt want to see them sneaking out to go to another room. State your goals up front. Tell
attendees what they will learn. You should also have an initial slide, a quotation, or a story that
grabs their attention.

### 10. Pace yourself
Some people naturally talk fast; others talk fast *when nervous*. You should speak just fast enough
to cover all the content, and slow enough to be understood by all. Be sure to enunciate and speak
clearly.

### 11. Avoid filler words
*Um*, *well*, if you have, *like*, a pre-teen and a teenager at home like I do, then
you‚Äôre *kinda* familiar with, *like*, filler words, sounds, and *whatever*. Filler words make your
communication less effective. You only have so many minutes to cover the content, so train
yourself to avoid them. Instead of filler words, you can... pause.

### 12. Pause 
At specific points in your presentation, be silent for one or more seconds. Make a pause 
- right after you make an important remark to let people absorb it; or
- right before making an important point to emphasize it. 
 
You can also combine the pause with the next tip.

### 13. Modulate your voice
Use inflection and vary the pitch of your voice to avoid a monotonic,
boring speech. Throughout your presentation you should speak loudly enough to be heard by
everybody in the room. You can lower your voice for emphasis: if you whisper a sentence, 
your audience will listen attentively, but you should do it sparingly.

### 14. Watch your posture
- **IN PERSON**:
    - Don‚Äôt turn sideways or turn your back to the audience. If you need to look at a slide,
      look at the laptop or monitor screen in front of you.
    - You may need to turn to the projection screen to use a laser pointer, but do it sparingly. People who like the pointer sometimes
      unintentionally overuse it by pointing it at every sentence and figure on the slides
    - Standing still behind the podium for your entire presentation is not ideal.
      Move closer to the audience, for example, to tell a story or answer a question. Move toward the screen to 
  emphasize the importance of the information on the slide.
    - Avoid pacing from side to side--some people do that when nervous, and it is distracting. Move purposefully.
    - Mind your posture: stand balanced when you are not moving, without rocking back and forth, and keep your hands 
  naturally at your sides or use them in meaningful ways in your communication.
- **ONLINE**:
    - Keep your camera on and in front of you--participants should not see you from an angle.
    - The camera should ideally be at eye level and not too close (within arm's length is a good distance).
    - Your background, be it virtual or real, should be static and reasonably clean, so it's not a distraction.

### 15. Tech prep in advance
- **IN PERSON**:
    - If you're presenting for the first time at a given venue, be there 30 minutes earlier to check that everything
  works, the Internet signal is good, monitor cable and projector configuration work with your laptop. 
    - If not using your own laptop, test that your presentation works fine with the computer to be used.
    - Don't forget to test the reproduction of audio and video files, in case you'll use any.
    - At conferences, sometimes we have zero minutes between the end of a presentation and the beginning of the next. 
  In that case, organizers recommend that you visit the presentation room during a break or the day before for tests.  
- **ONLINE**:
    - Make sure your camera is well positioned.
    - Use a lamp or light source *behind* the camera so people can see your face clearly.
    - Use a headset or lapel mic instead of the laptop built-in microphone to get better sound quality. The built-in mic 
  tends to capture more background noise (ex.: cooling fan) and noise from outside the room.
    - Become familiar with the meeting app to be used (zoom, Teams, google meet, etc.). In each of these apps, basic 
  features and resources (waiting room, participant list, chat, screen sharing, breakout room, whiteboarding, recording) 
  will work differently. As a presenter, it's your responsibility to know how to use the software even if there's a moderator to help you.
    - Use at least two monitors, one for the screen you will share and the other to visualize the participants and chat window. The
  second monitor allows you to keep an eye on chat messages, although for an interactive session with up to ~100 participants, 
  it's probably easier to ask them to open the mic when they want to ask a question.
